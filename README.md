 This is my first social media app using Kotlin and Firebase.
This app  is modelled after Twitter; users can post here and have other users like it.
You can like any tweet that is available on the app as a user.As a user, you can like any tweet present on the app.
I used RecyclerView(Adapter and ViewHolder) and Google login method.
